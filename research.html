            <p class="research-role">Towards Capable and Secure Autonomous Computer Use Agents - Fall <span class="year-font">'24</span> to Present</p>
            <br>Conducted as an NSF REU research scholar under the mentorship and guidance of <a href="https://carlosrubiomedrano.com/" style="color: #dfc9aa;">Dr. Carlos Rubio-Medrano.</a><br><br>
            <div class="research-desc">
                In this project, funded by two cycles of the NSF Computing Alliance of Hispanic-Serving Institutions REU program, 
                I investigated autonomous computer-use agents (ACUAs) â€” systems powered by large language models that 
                can operate a computer end-to-end. Unlike traditional chatbots, ACUAs navigate interfaces, execute tasks, 
                and make independent decisions, raising important questions about their reliability and security.  
                <br><br>
                I designed and introduced one of the first systematic evaluation frameworks for ACUAs, testing agents from 
                OpenAI, Anthropic, and open-source projects across five task domains of increasing complexity, adapting
                principles of an HCI IBM UI/UX quantitative assesssment to measure complexity. The study identified two classes of agents, full computer access 
                and browser-based agents.
                <br><br>
                Performance was measured with a seven-factor rubric assessing accuracy, adaptability, efficiency, 
                robustness, security, relevance, and consistency. Quantitative data such as completion rates, time, failed
                interactions, and remediation percentages were collected for evaluation.
                <br><br>
                Findings revealed significant limitations: full computer-access agents often failed due to hallucinations, 
                navigation errors, and unauthorized system changes, while browser-based agents achieved higher success 
                rates but still showed vulnerabilities to prompt injection and inconsistent security awareness. 
                <br><br>                
                These results currently guide the development of an ACUA, integrating multi-agent orchestration, 
                machine learning, RAG, and security frameworks including access control and prompt verification. 
                Potential approaches for addressing LLM limitations, including chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, are under investigation 
                to improve decision making.

                This work has been recognized with multiple honors, including a GMiS Student Poster Scholarship, an NSF Louis Stokes Alliance 
                for Minority Participation (LSAMP) Scholarship, a second NSF CAHSI REU award, and a scholarship with second place at the
                 international WiCyS Student Poster Competition.

            <p class="research-role">DEVELOPING AND OPTIMIZING LLM PIPELINES FOR SMART CITY SAFETY ANALYSIS - Summer <span class="year-font">'25</span> to Present</p>
            <br>Conducted as an NSF REU research scholar and research assistant, in the team of <a href="https://jeewoongpark.faculty.unlv.edu/" style="color: #dfc9aa;">Dr. Jee Woong Park</a> of UNLV,
            working in the projects of Unmesa Ray and Niloy Das.<br><br>

                 In this project, funded by the NSF Smart Cities Research Experience for Undergraduates program, I investigated 
                 large language model optimization techniques for analyzing unstructured construction safety data to enhance urban 
                 infrastructure development. Unlike traditional data analysis approaches, LLM-pipeline optimization enables automated extraction 
                 of critical insights from accident reports, raising important questions about scalability and real-world implementation in smart city frameworks.
                <br><br>
                <b><u>Project I:</u></b> As the computer scientist in a team of civil engineers, I developed novel LLM-pipeline optimization methods 
                to analyze construction accident reports, creating a prototype that processes unstructured safety data and extracts meaningful insights. 
                My work included researching optimized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and machine learning pipelines, and evaluating strategies 
                to improve efficiency while enhancing narrative tone extraction.
                <br><br>
                <b><u>Project II:</u></b> I collaborated on NDA research focused on machine learning for system analysis, collaborating 
                on techniques designed to enhance LLM performance and improve the accuracy of pattern extraction. My role was to work on implementing the AI aspects
                of the experiments, as the only computer science on board. 
                <br><br>
                While I cannot share specific findings prior to publication, I have been invited to continue collaborating as a research assistant. Project I
                has evolved quickly, and I now lead the LLM-driven analytical methods. In addition, I have contributed to manuscript development 
                and gained valuable experience quickly integrating into a new interdisciplinary team.
